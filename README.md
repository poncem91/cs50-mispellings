# CS50 - Speller
My work for HarvardX CS50's Speller assignment.

Implemented a dictionary for a program that spell-checks a file.

All of the code I wrote is in **dictionary.c**

The following files were provided by CS50 and I did not write any of the code from the below files:
* speller.c
* dictionary.h
* makefile
* files inside "dictionaries" folder
* files inside "text" folder
* files inside "keys" folder
